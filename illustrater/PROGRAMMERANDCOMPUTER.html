				<li>Then go to the line segment tool on the left side tool bar and draw lines from each of the big star 5 points dragging them to the top center of the page (to the right of the star). Make them about an inch long Don't let the line segemnts over lap the star.  </li>
				<li>Then on the right side connect the three points and connect them with two line segments so all the shapes are closed.</li>
