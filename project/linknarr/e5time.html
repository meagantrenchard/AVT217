		Rebellion. Although the Death
		Star has been destroyed,
		Imperial troops have driven the
		Rebel forces from their hidden
		base and pursued them across
		the galaxy.

		Evading the dreaded Imperial
		Starfleet, a group of freedom
		fighters led by Luke Skywalker
		has established a new secret
		base on the remote ice world
		of Hoth.

		obsessed with finding young
		Skywalker, has dispatched
		thousands of remote probes into
