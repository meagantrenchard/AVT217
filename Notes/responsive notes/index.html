						<p>ISTANBUL — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday that the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was a <q>planned</q> and <q>brutal</q> murder and called on Saudi Arabia to extradite 18 suspects to Turkey to face justice for the crime.</p>

						<p>Erdogan’s highly anticipated comments, during a speech to his ruling party in Ankara, the Turkish capital, contradicted Saudi accounts that Khashoggi was killed when an argument inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul escalated into a fistfight.</p>

					<div id="body-text">
						<p>The Turkish leader did not directly accuse the Saudi leadership of involvement in the killing but strongly indicated that the Saudi investigation, which has resulted in the arrests of 18 people so far, had not reached high enough into the kingdom’s ruling circles.  </p>

						<p><q>It will not satisfy the public by just pinning this kind of matter on a few security and intelligence officers,</q> he said. <q>Covering up this kind of savagery will hurt the conscience of all humanity.</q> </p>
